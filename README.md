RSSReader
=========
A porting of [iivanoo/CordovaBoilerplate](https://github.com/iivanoo/cordovaboilerplate) optimized for aggregating and reading news from a RSS source. For more information, visit [this site](https://github.com/iivanoo/cordovaboilerplate/blob/master/README.md).

This Boilerplate is ideal for developing mobile applications of blogs or newspapers.

This reader supports [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/reference) and **Facebook** via atom and [Twitter RSS Timeline](https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/11582) (soon).

**HOW IT WORKS**
With this boilerplate you have to work only on the graphics. The html files is in the www/templates folder, and the css file is in the www/style folder. Insert the URLs of your feeds in www/js/urlConfig.js file.
